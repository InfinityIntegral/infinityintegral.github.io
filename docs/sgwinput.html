#if SGWWidget
#d SGWInput is a SGWidget that provides an input field where the user can enter text. Callback functions are triggered when the text is changed, or when the input field gains or loses focus, allowing the user input to be processed. SGWInput has builtin support for SingCorrect, a SGEXTN module that allows users to enter Unicode characters, especially those used in Mathematics, using LaTeX style commands. Since SGWInput needs to intercept user input, it blocks SGWidgets below from receiving input. SGWInput is not directly instantiable and its instances can only be created using the constructors of its subclasses.
#dt <div id="-w"></div>_w Distance
The position and size of all SGWidgets are calculated using a <a class="link" href="#-w">_w</a> distance.$A _w distance is made of 2 coordinates, coordinate 1 and coordinate 0, and it is denoted using _w(c1, c0). This is equal to c1 * parent_size + c0 * size_unit pixels, where parent_size is the size of the parent SGWidget and size_unit is 1/24 of the screen width or screen height, whichever is longer.
#dt <div id="-c"></div> Theme Colours
SGWidgets follow a set of 9 chosen <a class="link" href="#-c">theme colours</a>. Each of these 9 colours have a index number between 0 and 8 which can be used to refer to them. If you want a SGWidget to have a colour that is not a theme colour, you must set it using a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxcolourrgba">SGXColourRGBA</a>. Setting a non theme colour switches the widget to non theme colour mode and ignores previously set theme colours. Setting a theme colour switches the widget to theme colour mode and ignores all previously set non theme colours.
