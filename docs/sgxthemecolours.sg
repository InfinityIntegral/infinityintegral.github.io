#c SGXThemeColours
class to access theme colours
#ic SGEXTN/bypassquickui/sgxthemecolours.h
#d This class provides functions to get the values of theme colours currently being used.
#sf SGXColourRGBA $getThemeColour(int themeColour)
This function gets the theme colour with index themeColour. Only indices between 0 and 8 inclusive are valid. If the index is invalid, a fully transparent colour is returned. Note that this is the same behaviour allowing you to pass -1 to the theme colour parameter in SGWidget functions to make invisible SGWidgets.
