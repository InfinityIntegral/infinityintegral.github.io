#if SGWWidget
#d SGWColourPickerWidget is a SGWidget that allows the user to pick a colour using the SGEXTN builtin colour picker. A callback function can be attached to the colour picker to run when a colour is chosen. Since user input has to be intercepted for interactivity, SGWidgets under the colour picker cannot receive user input.
#dt <div id="-w"></div>_w Distance
The position and size of all SGWidgets are calculated using a <a class="link" href="#-w">_w</a> distance.$A _w distance is made of 2 coordinates, coordinate 1 and coordinate 0, and it is denoted using _w(c1, c0). This is equal to c1 * parent_size + c0 * size_unit pixels, where parent_size is the size of the parent SGWidget and size_unit is 1/24 of the screen width or screen height, whichever is longer.
#dt <div id="-c"></div> Theme Colours
SGWidgets follow a set of 9 chosen <a class="link" href="#-c">theme colours</a>. Each of these 9 colours have a index number between 0 and 8 which can be used to refer to them. If you want a SGWidget to have a colour that is not a theme colour, you must set it using a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxcolourrgba">SGXColourRGBA</a>. Setting a non theme colour switches the widget to non theme colour mode and ignores previously set theme colours. Setting a theme colour switches the widget to theme colour mode and ignores all previously set non theme colours.

#f [[nodiscard]] SGXColourRGBA $getColour() const
This function gets the colour currently selected in this SGWColourPickerWidget. This is provided as a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxcolourrgba">SGXColourRGBA</a>.
#f void $setColour(SGXColourRGBA colour)
This function sets the colour currently selected in this SGWColourPickerWidget. This is provided as a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxcolourrgba">SGXColourRGBA</a>.
#f [[nodiscard]] float $getE1() const
This function gets the 1 coordinate of the border radius, which is a <a class="link" href="#-w">_w</a> distance. A border is placed around the colour picker so that it can be seen even when the colour selected is identical to the background colour.
#f void $setE1(float e1)
This function sets the 1 coordinate of the border radius, which is a <a class="link" href="#-w">_w</a> distance. A border is placed around the colour picker so that it can be seen even when the colour selected is identical to the background colour.
#f [[nodiscard]] float $getE0() const
This function gets the 0 coordinate of the border radius, which is a <a class="link" href="#-w">_w</a> distance. A border is placed around the colour picker so that it can be seen even when the colour selected is identical to the background colour.
#f void $setE0(float e0)
This function sets the 0 coordinate of the border radius, which is a <a class="link" href="#-w">_w</a> distance. A border is placed around the colour picker so that it can be seen even when the colour selected is identical to the background colour.
#f [[nodiscard]] void (*$getAttachedFunction() const)(SGWColourPickerWidget*)
This function gets the callback function attached to this SGWColourPickerWidget which is triggered when a colour is selected in the form of a function pointer. The callback function should return void and take as argument a pointer to a SGWColourPickerWidget which gives information about which colour picker triggered it.
#f void $setAttachedFunction(void (*function)(SGWColourPickerWidget*))
This function sets the callback function attached to this SGWColourPickerWidget which is triggered when a colour is selected in the form of a function pointer. The callback function should return void and take as argument a pointer to a SGWColourPickerWidget which gives information about which colour picker triggered it.
#f [[nodiscard]] int $getBackgroundThemeColour(bool* isUsing) const
This function gets the <a class="link" href="#-c">theme colour</a> used for the border of this SGWColourPickerWidget. The boolean isUsing is set to true if this SGWColourPickerWidget is in theme colour mode and false if this SGWColourPickerWidget is in non theme colour mode. If nullptr is passed to this function, no mode checking is done.
#f void $setBackgroundThemeColour(int themeColour)
