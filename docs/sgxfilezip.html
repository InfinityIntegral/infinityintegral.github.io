#c SGXFileZip
collection of functions related to zip files
#ic SGEXTN/filesystem/sgxfilezip.h
#d SGXFileZip is a non instantiable class containing static functions related to zip files. Zip files can be used to pack folders into a single file for easier sending and uploading, and they can be unpacked easily. Note that SGEXTN does not use actual zip files (.zip). Instead, SingZip files (.sgzip) are used, which are much easier and faster to create and unpack, but does not support checksums and compression.
#sf int $makeZip(const QString& path, const QString& zipLocation)
This function attempts to create a zip file at zipLocation using the folder found at path. This includes all files in the folder and in its subfolders recursively. The function returns$-1 if path or zipLocation or both are invalid$0 if no folder is found at path or if a file already exists at zipLocation$1 if the zip file is created successfully
#sf int $makeZip(const QVector&lt;QString&gt;& list, const QString& zipLocation)
This function attempts to make a zip file at zipLocation using the files at file paths in list. The root of the zip file is the lowest common parent folder of all the files in list. The function returns$-1 if zipLocation or any path in list is invalid$0 if no file is found at any path in list or a file already exists at zipLocation$1 if the zip file is created successfully
#sf int $unpackZip(const QString& zipLocation, const QString& path)
This function attempts to unpack the zip file found at zipLocation into a new folder created at path. The folder at path is used as the new root folder of the zip file. The function returns$-1 if path or zipLocation or both are invalid$0 if no file is found at zipLocation or a folder already exists at path$1 if the zip file is unpacked successfully
#sf int $unpackSingleFileFromZip(const QString& fileName, const QString& zipLocation, const QString& path)
This function attempts to extract a single file with relative path fileName from a zip file at zipLocation. The extracted file is placed at path. The function returns$-1 if path or zipLocation or both are invalid$0 if no file is found at zipLocation or no file with relative path fileName is found in the zip file or a file already exists at path$1 if the file is extracted successfully
#sf QVector&lt;std::tuple&lt;QString, long long&gt;&gt; $getContentsListFromZip(const QString& zipLocation);
This function gets the contents of a zip file at zipLocation in the form of a list. Each entry of the list corresponds to a file in the zip file, storing the relative path to the file and the size of the file in bytes. If zipLocation is invalid or no file is found there, an empty list is returned.
