#if SGWLabel
#d SGWSequentialLongLabel is a subclass of SGWLabel that can be used to display multiline text to users. It can be used to display instructions for using certain in-app functionality or to explain what some settings do. SGWSequentialLongLabel wraps text automatically and expands its height when needed, which can mess up UI page content layouts. It should be used inside a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgwsequentialscrollview">SGWSequentialScrollView</a> to ensure that the layout adapts to different screen sizes. SGWSequentialLongLabel does not prevent SGWidgets below it from receiving user input.
#dt <div id="-w"></div>_w Distance
The position and size of all SGWidgets are calculated using a <a class="link" href="#-w">_w</a> distance.$A _w distance is made of 2 coordinates, coordinate 1 and coordinate 0, and it is denoted using _w(c1, c0). This is equal to c1 * parent_size + c0 * size_unit pixels, where parent_size is the size of the parent SGWidget and size_unit is 1/24 of the screen width or screen height, whichever is longer.
#dt <div id="-c"></div> Theme Colours
SGWidgets follow a set of 9 chosen <a class="link" href="#-c">theme colours</a>. Each of these 9 colours have a index number between 0 and 8 which can be used to refer to them. If you want a SGWidget to have a colour that is not a theme colour, you must set it using a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxcolourrgba">SGXColourRGBA</a>. Setting a non theme colour switches the widget to non theme colour mode and ignores previously set theme colours. Setting a theme colour switches the widget to theme colour mode and ignores all previously set non theme colours.
