#c SGXFileReader
class to read binary file contents
#ic SGEXTN/filesystem/sgxfilereader.h
#d SGXFileReader is used to read data from a binary file written using <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxfilewriter">SGXFileWriter</a>. This can be done to read back user data saved in the form of binary files. You are strongly encouraged to use the extension .sg for configuration files, so that your app is literally "powered by Singapore".
#f $SGXFileReader(const QString& s)
This constructor of SGXFileReader creates a file reader that reads from the file at path s. No error checking is done, so you must ensure that the file exists and is in your app's folder before attempting to read from it.
#f [[nodiscard]] bool $readBool() const
This function reads a boolean from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] char $readChar() const
This function reads a C++ char from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards. You cannot read a QChar because SGEXTN does not provide a way to write a QChar, so you can never end up with a QChar in your file. To store a QChar, convert it to a QString and write the QString into the file.
#f [[nodiscard]] int $readInt() const
This function reads an integer from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] unsigned int $readUnsignedInt() const
This function reads an unsigned integer from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] long long $readLongLong() const
This function reads a long long from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] unsigned long long $readUnsignedLongLong() const
This function reads an unsigned long long from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] float $readFloat() const
This function reads a floating point number from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] double $readDouble() const
This function reads a double precision floating point number from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] QString $readString() const
This function reads a QString from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards. You cannot read a C++ string because SGEXTN does not provide a way to write a C++ string, so you can never end up with a C++ string in your file. To store a C++ string, convert it to a QString and write the QString into the file.
#f [[nodiscard]] SGXColourRGBA $readColourRGBA() const
This function reads a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxcolourrgba">SGXColourRGBA</a> representing a 8 bit RGBA colour from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] SGXColourHSLA $readColourHSLA() const
This function reads a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxcolourhsla">SGXColourHSLA</a> representing a colour in HSLA format from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] SGXTimeStamp $readTimeStamp() const
This function reads a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxtimestamp">SGXTimeStamp</a> representing a time accurate to the nearest second from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] SGXIdentifier $readIdentifier() const
This function reads a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxidentifier">SGXIdentifier</a> representing a global unique identifier (GUID) from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] SGXVector2 $readVector2() const
This function reads a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxvector2">SGXVector2</a> representing a 2 dimensional vector from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
#f [[nodiscard]] long long $getPointerLocation() const
This function gets the current location of the file reader pointer as a number of bytes from the start of the file.
#f void $setPointerLocation(long long x) const
This function sets the current location of the file reader pointer as a number of bytes from the start of the file. You must ensure that you do not read past the end of file since no error handling is done for that.
#f [[nodiscard]] bool $allDataRead() const
This function checks if the file reader pointer has reached the end of the file.
#f [[nodiscard]] QByteArray $readAllBytes() const
This function reads all the data contained in the file and returns it in the form of a QByteArray. This ignores the current location of the file reader pointer.
#f [[nodiscard]] QByteArray $readBytes(long long n) const
This function reads n bytes from the current location of the file reader pointer and returns it in the form of a QByteArray. This moves the file reader pointer forwards.
