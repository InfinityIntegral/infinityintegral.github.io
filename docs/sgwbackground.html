#c SGWBackground
SGWidget for background of UI pages
#ic SGEXTN/widgets/noninstantiable/sgwbackground.h
#if SGWWidget
#d SGWBackground is used to make the backgrounds of UI pages. Convenience functions are provided to enable and disable SGWBackground subclass instances. SGWBackground also blocks all user input, this ensures that the user would not accidentally affect the page behind while interacting with the current page. SGWBackground is not directly instantiable and instances can only be created using constructors of its subclasses.
#dt <div id="-w"></div>_w Distance
The position and size of all SGWidgets are calculated using a <a class="link" href="#-w">_w</a> distance.$A _w distance is made of 2 coordinates, coordinate 1 and coordinate 0, and it is denoted using _w(c1, c0). This is equal to c1 * parent_size + c0 * size_unit pixels, where parent_size is the size of the parent SGWidget and size_unit is 1/24 of the screen width or screen height, whichever is longer.
#dt <div id="-c"></div> Theme Colours
SGWidgets follow a set of 9 chosen <a class="link" href="#-c">theme colours</a>. Each of these 9 colours have a index number between 0 and 8 which can be used to refer to them. If you want a SGWidget to have a colour that is not a theme colour, you must set it using a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgxcolourrgba">SGXColourRGBA</a>. Setting a non theme colour switches the widget to non theme colour mode and ignores previously set theme colours. Setting a theme colour switches the widget to theme colour mode and ignores all previously set non theme colours.
#f [[nodiscard]] int $getThemeColour(bool* isUsing) const
This function gets the <a class="link" href="#-c">theme colour</a> used for the background of this SGWBackground. The boolean isUsing is set to true if this SGWBackground is in theme colour mode and false if this SGWBackground is in non theme colour mode. If nullptr is passed to this function, no mode checking is done.
#f void $setThemeColour(int themeColour)
This function sets the <a class="link" href="#-c">theme colour</a> used for the background of this SGWBackground. It also sets this SGWBackground to theme colour mode.
#f [[nodiscard]] SGXColourRGBA $getColour(bool* isUsing) const
This function sets the colour used for the background of this SGWBackground. The boolean isUsing is set to false if this SGWBackground is in theme colour mode and true if this SGWBackground is in non theme colour mode. If nullptr is passed to this function, no mode checking is done.
#f void $setColour(SGXColourRGBA colour)
This function sets the colour used for the background of this SGWBackground. It also sets this SGWBackground to non theme colour mode.
#sf void $enable(SGWBackground*& thisPointer, SGWBackground* (*initFunction)(), void (*resetFunction)())
This function enables and initialises a UI page. The pointer to the root SGWidget of the UI page, most likely currently storing nullptr, is passed to this function by reference so that it can be edited. A function pointer to a function that builds the UI on that page and returns a pointer to the root SGWidget of the built page should be passed to initFunction. A function pointer to a function that initialises the UI page, such as by filling in current or default values for all user input fields, should be passed to resetFunction. This function calls the passed functions appropriately and sets a pointer to the root SGWidget of the created UI page to thisPointer. If thisPointer is not nullptr, nothing is done as that would mean the UI page is currently active.
#sf void $disable(SGWBackground*& thisPointer)
This function disables a UI page. A function pointer to the root SGWidget of the UI page is passed to this function by reference so that it can be edited. This function deletes the UI page and sets thisPointer to nullptr to prevent memory leaks. If thisPointer is already nullptr, nothing is done as that would mean the UI page has already been disabled.
