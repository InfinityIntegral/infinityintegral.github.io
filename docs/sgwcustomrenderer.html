#d SGWCustomRenderer is a SGWidget that allows you to implement your own renderers. A renderer is a subclass of SGWCustomRenderer that directly uses the Qt Quick system to render objects on screen with GPU acceleration provided by Qt Quick. The renderer should interface with both Qt Quick and SGWidget. For more information, see the "Extending SGEXTN" section at <a class="link" href="./setup.html">this link</a> or look at the source code in your SGEXTN/colourpickerrendering/huechoice folder for an example. Renderers can be used to display shader outputs, non rectangular UI, and large amounts of UI efficiently. SGWCustomRenderer by itself does not intercept input and inputs can be received by SGWidgets below it. To make a SGWCustomRenderer accept user input, overlay a <a class="link" href="./classinfo.html?classname=sgwtouchreceiver">SGWTouchReceiver</a> on top of the custom renderer and make the callback function adjust properties of the custom renderer.
#dt <div id="-w"></div>_w Distance
The position and size of all SGWidgets are calculated using a <a class="link" href="#-w">_w</a> distance.$A _w distance is made of 2 coordinates, coordinate 1 and coordinate 0, and it is denoted using _w(c1, c0). This is equal to c1 * parent_size + c0 * size_unit pixels, where parent_size is the size of the parent SGWidget and size_unit is 1/24 of the screen width or screen height, whichever is longer.
#f $SGWCustomRenderer(SGWWidget* parent, const QString& qmlCodeLocation, float x1, float x0, float y1, float y0, float w1, float w0, float h1, float h0)

#f void $redraw()
This function redraws the SGWCustomRenderer. It should be called whenever properties of the SGWCustomRenderer are updated since the renderer does not automatically update.
