SGEXTN is 05524F's own framework for C++ application development that allows use of Qt Quick GUI features including QRhi through a simple, purely C++, API. Using SGEXTN to build apps would mean that you would not need to link Qt or the Standard Template Library directly (though the DLLs still must be provided), saving compilation time and clang-tidy scanning time significantly. SGEXTN provides container data structures, mathematical functions, a timer, file system and file access, a widget based GUI system, and a simple GPU rendering framework.
